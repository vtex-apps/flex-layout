# Flex Layout

Flex Layout is a **layout structure** built within VTEX IO store framework. It allows the construction of complex custom layouts using the concept of **rows** and **columns**, setting the desired structure and positioning of blocks in a given page.

## Configuration

There are **two basic building blocks of Flex Layout**: the `flex-layout.row` and the `flex-layout.col`. You should **never** use `flex-layout`.

If you are already familiar with the [`flexbox`](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) layout used in CSS, Flex Layout should be easy to get a grasp since that's what being used by `flex-layout.row` and `flex-layout.col` under the hood.

You can use **any** array of blocks as `flex-layout.row` and `flex-layout.col` children.

The props below support [`responsive-values`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/responsive-values), meaning that you can define to the same prop different values based on each device's screen size, such as mobile and desktop.

## Modus Operandi

- The highest level in a Flex Layout is **always** made of a row. Therefore, it is only possible to add a `flex-layout.col` inside of a `flex-layout.row` - never as a first-level block.
- Each row and column can have as **many levels as needed**.
- When creating levels, it is necessary to **alternate between rows and columns**. Within a row, you can only place columns, and within columns, only rows.
- Be mindful about the structure that you set in your flex layout does not only affect your code organization, but also reflects in the way that blocks will be shown and managed through the Site Editor admin. Therefore, it is always important to **take the organization of both code and Site Editor into account when planning to apply the Flex Layout** onto a page.

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).

| CSS Handles      |
| ---------------- |
| `flexColChild`   |
| `flexCol`        |
| `flexRowContent` |
| `flexRow`        |
| `flexRowItemWrapper` |
